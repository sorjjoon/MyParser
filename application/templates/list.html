    Saved matches. Placeholder so looks really dumb atm
    Note, Database has functionality for deleting a log file, and all matches associated with it, but this is not currently supported by the gui
    {%for log in logs%}

    ----------------
    <br>
        {%for match in log%}

        <td>{{ match }}</td>
        <br>
        {% endfor %}
    {% endfor %}
</p>
