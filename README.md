# MyParser
MyParser This project is for the interpretation (parsing) of combat logs provided by the role-playing game Star Wars The Old Republic (SWTOR). The goal is to provide users with statistics regarding their performance by analyzing logs provided by the user.

This project in particular deals with the storage of logs, and in particular logs for ranked pvp games and aims to provide the user statistics regarding played matches, win rate when playing with certain players etc.

When the application acually has some functionality beyond the current highly simplistic functions, I'll update this description to be more informative
