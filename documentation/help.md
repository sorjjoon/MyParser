To get started you'll need an account, which can be easily created by clicking "register" on the top right corner  
Once logged in, upload a new log file via the "Upload" link. 
Once uploaded the application will automatically detect the character used, as well as how many matches you played, how many rounds you played as well as who yo played with/against (in some cases this can't be determined automically, indicated by a "?" as a player name in team or opponents)  
To upload the log select win/loss for each round played, keep in mind the round win/loss need to be possible (games are best of 3, so for example if round was played rounds 1 and 2 can't both be wins)
A list of all logs you've uploaded, as well as the ability to modify them can be found in the "saved" tab, as well as the ability to modify or delette any previously uploaded log.   
Stats tab can be used to make queries to the database regarding the games you've played, parameters of the query can be modified by clicking parameters (note you need to choose a valid date range, or leave it blank to submit the query), note the "my class" and "server" query will always return no results if you haven't set your character class and server in the characters tab  
Details about your account can be accessed by clicking on your username in the top left corner (currently change password and delete your entire account)  
The characters tab can be accessed to see all characters you have uploaded, as well set their class and server  
The repo also automatically creates an admin user, admin, admin. Currently the admin only has the ability to see every other username in the application, with thr "users" tab on the top right
